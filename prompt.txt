I’m working on a Firebase + Next.js project and encountering a login error.

When accessing the login screen (`/login`), I see the following error:

❌ Firebase Authentication Error:
auth/configuration-not-found  
Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)

And the browser console shows:
400 (Bad Request)  
https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/projects?key=[my_api_key]

Here’s what I’ve confirmed:
- The Firebase project ID is `voicecast-firebase`
- The Google Sign-In provider is enabled in Firebase Authentication
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env.local`
- All other Firebase credentials (project ID, app ID, auth domain, etc.) are set
- Hosting URL is `https://voicecast-firebase.web.app`

Despite that, the error persists.

Please:
1. Tell me **exactly what kind of misconfiguration would cause auth/configuration-not-found**
2. What additional settings or APIs I must enable (e.g., Identity Toolkit, OAuth consent screen, etc.)
3. Point out what part of the `.env.local` might be incorrect or mismatched

Respond as a professional Firebase engineer who knows where this misconfiguration usually happens.
